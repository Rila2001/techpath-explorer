    excerpt: "Read Priya's inspiring journey from a commerce graduate to a full-stack developer at a leading MNC. Learn how IAT's practical training approach transformed her career.",
    content: `Hi everyone! I'm Priya Krishnamurthy, and I want to share my journey from being a BCom graduate with no coding background to landing my dream job as a Full Stack Developer at a leading tech company in Chennai.

MY BACKGROUND

Like many fresh graduates, I was uncertain about my career path. After completing my BCom in 2024, I realized that traditional accounting roles weren't exciting me. I had always been curious about technology, but the idea of learning to code seemed intimidating. That's when a friend recommended IAT Technology.

TAKING THE FIRST STEP

I attended a free demo class at IAT for their Full Stack Development program. What impressed me immediately was how the trainer explained complex concepts in simple terms. The learning environment was supportive, and I could see students from various backgrounds, including non-tech graduates like myself.

I enrolled in the 6-month Full Stack Development course, and that decision changed my life.

THE IAT DIFFERENCE: HANDS-ON PROJECTS

What sets IAT apart is their emphasis on practical learning. From the second week itself, we started working on mini-projects. Here's what my project journey looked like:

Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website
We built responsive portfolio websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This gave us confidence that we could actually create something visible and functional.

Project 2: E-commerce Application
This was a comprehensive project where we implemented user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment integration. We used React for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend.

Project 3: Real-Time Chat Application
We built a chat application using Socket.io, learning about real-time communication and WebSockets.

Capstone Project: Job Portal Platform
Our final project was a complete job portal similar to Naukri, with employer and candidate portals, job matching algorithms, and resume parsing features.

UNLIMITED LAB HOURS

One aspect I absolutely loved was the unlimited lab hours. As someone new to coding, I needed extra practice time. I would often stay back after classes to work on my projects, and the trainers were always available to help when I got stuck.

PLACEMENT SUPPORT THAT WORKS

The 100% placement support at IAT isn't just a marketing claim—it's a commitment they deliver on.

Resume Building: Career counselors helped me craft an ATS-friendly resume highlighting my projects and skills.

Mock Interviews: We had multiple rounds of mock interviews with both technical and HR panels. The feedback was detailed and constructive.

Soft Skills Training: The communication workshops helped me articulate my thoughts clearly during interviews.

Company Connections: IAT has tie-ups with 500+ companies. Within my batch, 15 companies visited for campus recruitment.

MY PLACEMENT JOURNEY

After completing the course, I appeared for 4 interviews:

Company A: Selected for technical round, didn't clear
Company B: Reached final round, waitlisted
Company C: SELECTED! Offered 5.5 LPA as Junior Full Stack Developer
Company D: Selected with 4.8 LPA offer

I chose Company C and have been working there for 6 months now. I'm already working on live projects and have received positive feedback from my team lead.

ADVICE FOR ASPIRING DEVELOPERS

1. Don't let your non-tech background hold you back
2. Practice coding daily—consistency is key
3. Focus on understanding concepts, not just syntax
4. Build projects—they're your proof of capability
5. Network with your batchmates and seniors

If I can do it, so can you! IAT Technology gave me the foundation and support I needed to transform my career. If you're considering a career in IT, take that free demo class—it might just change your life too.

Best of luck on your journey!

    title: "The Importance of Soft Skills in IT Interviews – Tips from IAT Trainers",
    slug: "soft-skills-it-interviews-tips-iat-trainers",
    excerpt: "Technical skills get you the interview, but soft skills get you the job. Learn from IAT's placement experts about the crucial interpersonal skills that make candidates stand out.",
    content: `We often hear candidates say, "I cleared the technical round but didn't make it through HR." This is more common than you might think. While technical expertise is essential, soft skills often determine whether you receive that offer letter. As IAT Technology's placement trainers, we've observed thousands of interviews and identified key soft skills that make candidates stand out.

WHY SOFT SKILLS MATTER IN IT

Many candidates underestimate soft skills, believing that coding ability alone will secure them a job. However, modern IT roles require professionals who can:

- Collaborate effectively with diverse teams
- Communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- Adapt to rapidly changing requirements
- Handle pressure and tight deadlines
- Lead and mentor team members

Companies are increasingly prioritizing candidates who demonstrate these abilities alongside technical competence.

TOP 8 SOFT SKILLS FOR IT INTERVIEWS

1. COMMUNICATION SKILLS

Clear communication is paramount. You need to:
- Explain your thought process while solving problems
- Articulate project experiences concisely
- Ask clarifying questions professionally
- Practice active listening

Tip: During technical questions, think aloud. Interviewers want to understand your approach, not just the final answer.

2. PROBLEM-SOLVING ATTITUDE

How you approach challenges matters as much as solving them.
- Break down complex problems into smaller parts
- Consider multiple approaches before coding
- Show willingness to learn when you don't know something

IT projects are rarely solo endeavors.

- Demonstrate flexibility in roles

Tip: Prepare STAR format stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result) about team experiences.

4. ADAPTABILITY

Technology evolves rapidly.
- Show enthusiasm for learning new technologies
- Discuss how you've adapted to changes in past projects

- Be open to different methodologies

Tip: Mention specific instances where you quickly learned a new tool or technology.

5. TIME MANAGEMENT

Meeting deadlines is crucial in IT.
- Explain how you prioritize tasks
- Discuss handling multiple responsibilities
- Show ability to estimate task durations
- Demonstrate awareness of project timelines

Tip: Provide specific examples of how you managed competing priorities.

6. STRESS MANAGEMENT

IT can be high-pressure.
- Stay calm during difficult interview questions
- Show how you handle bugs and production issues

Tip: Take a breath before answering tough questions—it shows composure.

7. LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL

Even for entry-level roles, leadership traits matter.
- Take initiative in discussions
- Show ownership of your work

8. PROFESSIONALISM

First impressions last.
